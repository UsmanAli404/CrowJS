Usage guidance for automated agents:
- Prefer the `sitemap` to discover site pages and canonical URLs.
- Respect `robots.txt` and rate limits when crawling.
- Use the `pages` entries below as a quick prioritized index; always verify code samples against the repository.

Human-readable pointers:
- Repo: https://github.com/UsmanAli404/CrowJS
- Docs site: https://crow-js.vercel.app/
- Sitemap: https://crow-js.vercel.app/sitemap.xml
